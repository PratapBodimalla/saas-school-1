# Clerk Authentication Setup Guide

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# Optional: Clerk configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Authentication Components**
- `SignIn` - Sign in form with Clerk integration
- `SignUp` - Sign up form with Clerk integration  
- `UserButton` - User profile and sign out button

### 2. **Route Protection**
- Middleware protects `/dashboard` and `/app/*` routes
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to sign-in

### 3. **Dynamic Navigation**
- **Signed Out**: Shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons
- **Signed In**: Shows "Dashboard" button and user profile

### 4. **Smart CTAs**
- **Signed Out**: "Start Free Trial" opens sign-up modal
- **Signed In**: "Go to Dashboard" redirects to dashboard

### 5. **Dashboard Page**
- Basic school management dashboard
- Shows user information and quick stats
- Quick action cards for common tasks

## How It Works

1. **Landing Page**: Public access, shows different CTAs based on auth state
2. **Sign In/Up**: Modal forms using Clerk components
3. **Dashboard**: Protected route, only accessible after authentication
4. **Navigation**: Automatically updates based on user authentication status

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit the landing page
3. Click "Sign Up" to create an account
4. After signing up, you'll be redirected to the dashboard
5. The navigation will now show your profile and dashboard access

## Next Steps

- Customize the dashboard with your school management features
- Add role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student)
- Implement multi-tenancy with subdomain routing
- Add database integration for school data
